# Carbon Dioxide Emissions Forecasting

This project analyzes country-specific environmental and economic data from the World Bank in Python to identify key features predictive of countries’ carbon dioxide emissions and builds a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict countries’ carbon dioxide emissions with high accuracy.

## Key Feautures 

- Feature Selection: Applies random forest-based feature selection to identify the four most predictive features of countries’ carbon dioxide emissions
- Model Building: Develops a KNN classification model
- Visualization: Plots confusion matrices and decision regions to evaluate model performance
 
## Contents

- data/: Folder containing the World Bank datasets
- carbon_dioxide_emissions_forecasting.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all code for analysis, model building, and visualization
